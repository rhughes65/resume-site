As a test technician for Blue Origin's child company Honeybee Robotics, I tested Solar Array Drive Assemblies (SADA) units made for MicroSat utilization. Most famous of these uses was NASA's Artemis II flight, scheduled for 2026. This involved rigorous thermal vacuum and environmental chamber cycles to ensure flight-ready reliability. Additionally, I contributed to the testing of Firefly Aerospace's Trident drill motors, further expanding my experience in aerospace component validation.

## Key Learnings
- **Team Leadership**: Led 24/7 test campaigns and developed training manuals and visual management systems to ensure team alignment.
- **Technical Compliance**: Maintained 100% safety compliance while operating complex thermal vacuum and environmental chambers (TVAC).
- **Problem Solving**: Partnered directly with engineers to troubleshoot testing anomalies and resolve technical issues, significantly reducing test delays.
